                <p>A coffeehouse, coffee shop, or café, is an establishment that serves 
                  various types of coffee, espresso, latte, americano and cappuccino, among other hot beverages. 
                  Some coffeehouses may serve iced coffee among other cold beverages, such as iced tea, as well as 
                  other non-caffeinated beverages. A coffeehouse may also serve food, such as light snacks, sandwiches, 
                  muffins, cakes, breads, pastries, and/or donuts. Many doughnut shops in the Canadian and U.S. serve 
                  coffee as an accompaniment to doughnuts. In continental Europe, some cafés even serve alcoholic 
                  beverages. Coffeehouses range from owner-operated small businesses to large multinational corporations. 
                  Some coffeehouse chains operate on a franchise business model, with numerous branches across various 
                  countries around the world.</p>

            <p>Labor rights or workers' rights are both legal rights and human rights relating to labor relations between 
              workers and employers. These rights are codified in national and international labor and employment law. 
              In general, these rights influence working conditions in the relations of employment. One of the most prominent 
              is the right to freedom of association, otherwise known as the right to organize. Workers organized in trade unions
               exercise the right to collective bargaining to improve working conditions.</p>
